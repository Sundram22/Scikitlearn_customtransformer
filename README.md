# Custom Stateless Transformers
Transformers that do not learn from data do not require a fit method. Ex - Sqare , Cube , Reciprocal , SIN , COS etC

## Cubic Transformation Linear Regression

This repository contains a Python implementation of a linear regression model using a custom cubic transformation on the input features. The model is built using `numpy` for mathematical operations and `scikit-learn` for machine learning functionalities.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to apply a custom transformation to features before fitting a linear regression model. The transformation used here is a cubic transformation, which raises each feature to the power of three.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following packages installed:

- numpy
- scikit-learn
